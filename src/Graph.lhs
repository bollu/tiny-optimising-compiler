<h1> Graph </h1>
In this module, we define a simple `graph` structure that can be used
as:

- an undirected.
- a directed graph.
- a tree.

Ideally, we would use some sort of phantom-type mechanism to distinguish
between the two, that is `Graph Undirected a` and `Graph Directed a`, but
oh well `:)`.
